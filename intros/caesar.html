            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence, the Caesar Shift is a type of
                <strong>substitution cipher</strong>. Caesar would shift each letter of his message by a fixed number of
                positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' would be replaced by 'D', 'B' would
                become 'E', and so on.

            <h2>How it Works</h2>
            <p>The encryption can be represented using modular arithmetic by first transforming the letters into
                numbers, according to the scheme, A = 0, B = 1, ..., Z = 25.</p>
            <p>Encryption of a letter <code>x</code> by a shift <code>n</code> can be described mathematically as:</p>
            <p><code>E_n(x) = (x + n) mod 26</code></p>
            <p>Decryption is performed similarly:</p>
            <p><code>D_n(x) = (x - n) mod 26</code></p>

            <h2>The Wheel</h2>
            <p>To make this process easier, cipher discs or "Caesar Wheels" were invented. These consist of two rotating
                disks with the alphabet written on them. By aligning the inner disk relative to the outer disk, one can
                quickly encrypt and decrypt messages without doing mental math.</p>
