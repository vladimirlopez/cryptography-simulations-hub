            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The scytale (rhymes with "Italy") is one of the earliest known cryptographic devices, used by the
                Spartans around 400 BC. Unlike the Caesar cipher which changes the <em>identity</em> of letters, the
                Scytale changes their <em>position</em>. This is known as a <strong>transposition cipher</strong>.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="intro-section">
            <h2>The Mechanism</h2>
            <p>The system consisted of a tapered cylinder (the scytale) and a strip of parchment. To encrypt a message,
                the sender would wrap the parchment spirally around the rod and write the message lengthwise along the
                rod.</p>
            <p>When unwrapped, the strip would appear to contain a random scramble of letters. The only way to decrypt
                the message was to wrap the strip around a rod of the exact same diameter.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="intro-section">
            <h2>Why it Worked</h2>
            <p>Without the correct rod diameter, the letters wouldn't align to form words. If you wrapped it around a
                stick that was too thick or too thin, the letters would meet their neighbors incorrectly, keeping the
                message hidden.</p>
